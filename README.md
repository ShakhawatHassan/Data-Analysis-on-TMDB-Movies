# Data-Analysis-on-TMDB-Movies
In the first section, I pulled up the tmdb datasets. Next, then I cleaned the data, fixed the data type, split the rows which carry "|", remove null values, and remove duplicate rows. Before cleaning the datasets, I had 10,866 rows and 21 columns. After cleaning the datasets,  In the exploratory section, I looked for the findings. For instance, action, adventure, drama, comedy and thriller genres are most popular from year to year (1960-2015). Action and adventure take the highest place for genres. Avatar is the highest grossing movie of all time (rev 2.78 Billion). Furthermore, The mean revenue was about 107 Million and the highest budget of a film was about 425 million. As the year goes on, the number of movies is increasing.  On the same hand, genres, casts, directors are the main properties which heavily depend on a film's revenue. For example, Avatar is an action packed film which is directed by James Cameron, and it's the highest grossing film of all time (as of 2015). Top 3 directors are Steven Spielberg, James Cameron and Peter Jackson. Steven Spielberg is the number one director among all of them. Moreover, Harrison Ford, Tom Cruise, and Tom Hanks are the ones who have gotten the highest revenues. Lastly, there hasn't been any correlation found between budget and revenue, and revenue and runtime.
