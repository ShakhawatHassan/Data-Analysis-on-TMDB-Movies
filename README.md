# Data-Analysis-on-TMDB-Movies
> This project is a data analysis on TMDB-movies datasets. By analyzing the datasets, I will have an idea of which genres are performing well or not. In order for me to do this analysis, I have to do the followings,
pull up the datasets (tmdb-movies.csv)
data cleaning, data cleansing, data wrangling, fixing the null values, and etc. 
visualize the data and look for statistical results.
I will try to answer these questions based on the datasets. 
Which movies earned the most? Which genres are more popular than other genres? Which properties generated the most revenues? Which genres are performing well over the years? Which are the 10 highest-grossing movies of all time?
